# What is the background of your company? 
Vitalik worked for Bitcoin magazine. He saw that new cryptos needed to create their own blockchain in order to exist. He saw this as an opporutnity to improve upon Bitcoin's technology. His vision was to create one decentralized blockchain where all of the apps can co-exist.
# What do they do? 
Ethereum provides a decentralized network that allow apps to function on the blockchain using proof of work and soon to be proof of stake with Ethereum 2.0. Etherium also uses smart contracts to secure and validate transactions. 
# Who are their competitors? 
XRP, Cardano, Binance, and Polkadot are competitors for Etherium.
# How does this company use technology to their advantage? 
Allows for decentralized app (DApps) creation. Each hash on the Ethereum blockchain is a smart contract that cannot be reversed or modified. 
# Why are they considered a FinTech company?
Ethereum utilizes cryptocurrency, blockchain, and smart contract technologies which are primary components of the FinTech industry.
# Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? 
They are the first FinTech company that allowed layer 2 apps to run on top of their blockchain.
# What are their strengths and weaknesses?
One perceived weakness is the environmental impact due to the amount of power needed to verify trasactions using "proof of work" on the Ethereum network. This should be resolved once Ethereum moves to "proof of stake" on the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain network in order to verify transactions. Another weakness are the high "gas fees" which is the price paid for each transaction on the network. Finally, the transaction speeds per seconds is slow especially when there is high cingestion or in comparison to blockchain networks such as XRP. A strength for Etherium is experience as they are considered to be innovators in the blockchain / cryptocurrency space. In addition, it is a platform and not just a cryptocurrency. Many of the advancements in the blockchain space such as Dapps, NFT's, and smart contracts are made possible because of the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain.
# What is the prognosis for this company? 
TO THE MOON!!!!!!!
# Where do they expect to be in the future?
Once mainstream adoption has taken pace within the next 5-10 years, Ethereum blockchain will be used for things such as voting, transfering real property rights, as well as validating ownership in the virtual and physical world.
